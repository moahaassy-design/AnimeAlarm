## 2025-12-24 - Confirmation for Destructive Actions

**Learning:** Adding a confirmation dialog before executing a destructive action (like deleting an alarm) is a simple but critical UX improvement. It prevents users from making irreversible mistakes with a single accidental tap, which builds trust and makes the application feel safer and more reliable.

**Action:** In future tasks, I will actively look for any destructive actions that lack a confirmation step. This pattern is a high-impact, low-effort enhancement that aligns perfectly with my goal of improving usability and accessibility.
